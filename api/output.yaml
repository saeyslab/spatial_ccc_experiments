          - For methods that output one summary of interactions for the whole slide/sampleDataframe containing a dataframe containing {'source_ct', 'receiver_ct', 'ligand', 'receptor'}. 
          - For methods that output a summary for the whole slide but with respect to cell type annotations (i.e., per source - target) it is a dataframe containing {'ligand', 'receptor'}.
