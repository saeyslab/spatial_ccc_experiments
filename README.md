# spatial_ccc_experiments

This repository contains experiments with performing spatial ccc. Our current aims are to:

* List a few candidate datasets
* Decide on a common input format
* Decide on a common output format
* Implement a selection of spatial CCC methods
* Run all methods on all datasets
* Compare outputs (visually, or with a metric)
